<p>üöÄÔ∏è Planner 2 is here...</p>

</ul>
<p>Everyone needs a task manager and Planner adapts to anyone&apos;s needs</p>
<p>How Planner works:</p>
<p>1. Collect your Ideas - The Inbox is your default task list in Planner. When you add a task, it goes straight to your Inbox unless you specify that the task goes into a project.</p>
<p>2. Get Organized - Create a project for each of your goals, then add the steps to reach them. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.</p>
<p>3. Calendar and Events - See your calendar events and plan your time effectively. Planner will remind you on the right day.</p>
<p>4. Be even more organized - Add a duedate to your tasks, create labels, use checklists.</p>
<p>‚òÅÔ∏è Support for Todoist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Synchronize your Projects, Task and Sections thanks to Todoist.</li>
  <li>Support for Todoist offline: Work without an internet connection and when everything is reconnected it will be synchronized.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Planner not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist</p>
<p>üíéÔ∏è Other features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚è≤Ô∏è Reminders notifications</li>
  <li>üîçÔ∏è Quick Find</li>
  <li>üåôÔ∏è Night mode</li>
