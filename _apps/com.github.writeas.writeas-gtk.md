  <li>Instantly launches to a blank page or your last draft</li>
  <li>Writing automatically saves as you type</li>
  <li>Work on a single local draft, then publish or save as another file when you&apos;re finished</li>
  <li>Choose from three different fonts: serif, sans-serif, or monospace</li>
  <li>Dark mode on platforms that support it</li>
  <li>Publish to Write.as and share your post (example)</li>
