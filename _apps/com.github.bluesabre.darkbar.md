<p>Darkbar replaces window decorations with your preference of a dark or light theme variant.</p>
<p>It allows the following settings for each application:</p>
<ul>
<li>None: Let the application decide</li>
<li>Follow System Theme: Use the same theme as the operating system</li>
<li>Light: Prefer the "light" theme variant</li>
<li>Dark: Prefer the "dark" theme variant</li>
</ul>
<p>Only applications using traditional decorations are supported. If your app is unaffected by Darkbar, the application controls its window decorations.</p>
