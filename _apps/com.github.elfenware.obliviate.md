<p>Obliviate does not store your passwords but gives them to you when you need them. How?</p>
<p>It asks you for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the site you want to log in to</li>
<li>a cipher key, which is any passphrase you can remember</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these, it will derive a password, which you can set as your new password for that site.</p>
<p>The next time you need it, enter the same site and same cipher key. Obliviate will derive the same password as before.</p>
<p>It’s not magic, but it’s quite close.</p>
<p>Bonus: If you need your passwords on another device, you can get them on the web from obliviate.app.</p>
