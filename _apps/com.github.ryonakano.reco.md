<p>Reco is an audio recorder focused on being concise and simple to use.</p>
<p>You can use it to record and remember spoken words, system audio, improvized melodies, and anything else you can do with a microphone, speaker, or both.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording sounds from both your microphone and system at the same time. This is useful for recording calls or streaming videos on the Internet.</li>
<li>Saving in many commonly used formats. It supports ALAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, and WAV.</li>
<li>Timed recording. You can set a delay before recording up to 15 seconds, and set the length of recording up to 600 seconds.</li>
<li>Choosing where to save recordings. You can select whether the app saves recordings into a directory of your choosing automatically or manually.</li>
<li>Saving recordings when the app quits. Even if you happen to quit the app while recording, the recording is either saved automatically, or the file chooser dialog is shown - depending on your preferences.</li>
</ul>
