<p>Add portable apps like raw executable files, AppImage files, etc. into your application launcher easily. Edit or delete existing app entries without opening a file manager.</p>
<p>Pin It! comes with syntax errors detection, so you will never need to waste your time seeking for why your desktop entry won't be shown in the launcher.</p>
