<li>Saving in some commonly used formats. It supports AAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, and WAV</li>
<li>Timed recording. You can set a delay before recording up to 15 seconds, and the length of recording up to 600 seconds</li>
<li>Autosaving or always-ask-where-to-save workflow. You can select whether the app saves recordings automatically or you choose a destination each time on saving them</li>
