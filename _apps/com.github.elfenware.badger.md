<p>When you are using your computer for extended periods of time, you need to relax your body every once in a while.</p>
<p>Badger helps you do exactly that. It reminds you—or should I say, badgers you—to destress yourself and rest your eyes and muscles.</p>
<p>Currently, it has these eight reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blink eyes</li>
<li>Stretch fingers</li>
<li>Stretch arms</li>
<li>Stretch legs</li>
<li>Turn neck</li>
<li>Maintain posture</li>
<li>Drink water</li>
<li>Breathe consciously</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay healthy.</p>
