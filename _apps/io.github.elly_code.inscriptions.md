<p>A fast, pretty, and ready translation app using DeepL free and paid API</p>
<p>Libretranslate support is considered, but </p>
<p>Some points of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nimble: Paste your DeepL api key (Whichever the plan), and here you go!</li>
<li>Thoughtful: Just what you need, out of your way and a click away</li>
<li>Comprehensive: No scary angry dialogs - If something goes wrong, explain nicely</li>
<li>Lean: Limiting resource usage and internet communications to the minimum</li>
<li>Supported languages: All those available via DeepL API!</li>
</ul>
