<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stays on top of your desktop, giving you a quick glimpse of the exchange rates during the day</li>
<li>Supports many different currencies and updates the rates every hour throughout weekdays</li>
<li>Indicates whether the rate has increased or decreased compared to previous day</li>
</ul>
