<p>Whether you're dashing through Mario Kart on MupenGUI, binge-watching Silicon Valley on Cinema, or writing your next novel on Quilter, you need to relax your body every once in a while.</p>
<p>Badger helps you do exactly that. It reminds you—or should I say, badgers you—to destress yourself and rest your eyes and muscles.</p>
<p>Currently, it has these five reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blink eyes</li>
<li>Stretch fingers</li>
<li>Stretch arms</li>
<li>Stretch legs</li>
<li>Turn neck</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay healthy.</p>
